# Act 1.1 Recursion - Abraham Cepeda Oseguera - A00827666
This activity consists of several algorithms that implements recursion to solve the problem

## Complexity of each function (Recursive ones)
* Factorial   - O(n)
* Sumas       - O(n)
* Pyramid     - O(n)
* Fibonacci   - O(2n)
* Bacteria    - O(n)
* Investment  - O(n)
* Power       - O(n)

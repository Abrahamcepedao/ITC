# Act 1.2 Search and order algorithms - Abraham Cepeda Oseguera - A00827666
This activity consists of several algorithms that implements binary search algorithms and order algorithms

## Complexity of each algorithm
* Factorial   - O(n)
* Sumas       - O(n)
* Pyramid     - O(n)
* Fibonacci   - O(n)
* Bacteria    - O(n)
* Investment  - O(n)
* Power       - O(n)
